# A-star-path-finder
This code finds the shortest path between two points given the constraints imposed by the user. 
- the first two clicks on the grid will be the start and end point.
- third click onwards, every click will be treated as a constraint which should be excluded from the shortest path. 
- the final shortest path will be shown using a purple line.
